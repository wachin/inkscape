This directory contains code related to the Inkscape desktop, that is
code that is directly used by the InkscapeWindow class and in linking
the desktop to the canvas. It should not contain basic widgets,
dialogs, toolbars, etc.

To do:

* widgets/desktop-widget.h/cpp should disappear with code ending up in either
  InkscapeWindow.h/cpp or desktop.h/cpp (or in new files).

* ui/view/view-widget.h/cpp should disappear ('view' should be member of window)

* desktop.h/cpp should only contain code that links the desktop to the canvas.

* Convert GUI to use actions where possible.

* Future Structure:
    Main menu bar   (menubar.h/.cpp)
    Tool bar
    Multipaned widget containing
        Dialogs
        Tools
        Canvas
    Palette (maybe turn into dialog).
    Status bar
