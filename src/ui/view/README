This directory contains the class Inkscape::UI::View::View and related items.

View is an abstract base class for all UI document views. Documents
can be displayed by more than one window, each having its own view
(e.g. zoom level, selection, etc.).

View is the base class for:

* SPDesktop
* SVGView  REMOVED

SPViewWidget is the base for:

* SPDocumentWidget
* SPSVGViewWidget  REMOVED

SPSVGViewWidget has been replaced by SVGViewWidget, see below.


SPViewWidget:
  Contains a GtkEventBox and holds a View.

SPDesktopWidget:
  Contains:
    VBox
      HBox
        GtkGrid
         GtkPaned
           GtkGrid
             SPCanvas
   Plus lots of other junk.


SVGViewWidget:
  Used many places as a convenient way to show an SVG (file dialog, Inkview).
  Derived, rather uselessly, from Gtk::Scrollbar.
  It no longer is dependent on View (and really doesn't belong here anymore).

 It contains: SPCanvas

To do:


* Convert everything to C++.
* Evaluate moving SPDesktopWidget down the widget stack.
  It doesn't use the EventBox of SPViewWidget!

A DesktopViewWidget should contain:
  DesktopView (aka SPDesktop)
  SPCanvas
