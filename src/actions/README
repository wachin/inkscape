This directory contains Gio::Actions.

"A GAction (Gio::Action) is a representation of a single
user-interesting action in an application."
(https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GAction)

In more layman terms, it provides a uniform interface for calling
functions with an optional single parameter that is not tied to the
GUI.

Actions provide two operations:

* activation (which results in calling the function),
* state change (if the action supports a state).

While actions are defined independent of the GUI (unlike GtkAction),
the can be used by "actionable widgets" (menus, buttons, etc.) by
simply referring to them by name. They can also be remotely activated
by D-Bus and GNotifications.

To do:

* Convert 'verbs' to Gio::Actions.
* Update command line to use actions.
* Update GUI to use actions.
