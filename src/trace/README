This directory contains code for converting bitmap images to vector images.
The subdirectories contain code for the three tracers used in Inkscape: potrace
(external dependency), autotrace, and libdepixelize (currently in src/3rdparty).


To do:

* Think about conceptually changing how the tracing works: Ideally, it should
  be three steps clearly separated:
  1/ Preprocessing (color reduction, blurring, background removing, image
    inversion...)
  2/ Tracing the preprocessed image, using some tracing engine
  3/ Post-processing (suppressing speckles, optimizing paths...)
  
  The main problem is that the tracing engine sometimes *also* does 1 and 3, so
  there is some discussion to have whether this can be done.
