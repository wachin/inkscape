This directory contains code for rendering graphics to the
canvas. This includes rendering of SVG elements (DrawingItem and
derived classes) as well as rendering of control items -
nodes/handles/lines (CanvasItem and derived classes).

Currently we rely on the "Cairo" graphics library for rendering.

To do:

* Split into three directories: drawing, canvas, common.
* Remove SPCurve.
