What is The Croco Project ?
------------------------------

Libcroco is a standalone css2 parsing and manipulation library.
The parser provides a low level event driven SAC like api
and a css object model like api.
Libcroco provides a CSS2 selection engine and an experimental
xml/css rendering engine.

This is a fork of the original
[Gnome libcroco](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/libcroco)
project, which was discontinued. It's sole purpose is to be used with
[Inkscape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape).
