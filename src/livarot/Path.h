/**
 * Path and its polyline approximation.
 *
 * A Path is exactly analogous to an SVG path element. Like the SVG path element, this class
 * stores path commands. A Path can be approximated by line segments and this approximation
 * is known as a "polyline approximation". Internally, the polyline approximation is stored
 * as a set of points.
 *
 * Each path command (except the MoveTo), creates a new segment. A path segment can be defined
 * as a function of time over the interval [0, 1]. Each point in the polyline approximation can
 * store the index of the path command that created the path segment that it came from and the time
 * value at which it existed. The midpoint of a line segment would be at \f[ t = 0.5 \f] for
 * example. This information is known as "back data" since it preserves the information about the
 * original segments that existed in the path and can help us recreate them or their portions back.
 * Note that the first point of a subpath stores the index of the moveTo command.
 *
 * To use this class create a new instance. Call the command functions such as Path::MoveTo,
 * Path::LineTo, Path::CubicTo, etc to append path commands. Then call one of Path::Convert,
 * Path::ConvertEvenLines or Path::ConvertWithBackData to generate the polyline approximation.
 * Then you can do simplification by calling Path::Simplify or fill a Shape by calling Path::Fill
 * on the shape to use features such as Offsetting, Boolean Operations and Tweaking.
 *
 *     Path *path = new Path;
 *     path->MoveTo(Geom::Point(10, 10));
 *     path->LineTo(Geom::Point(100, 10));
 *     path->LineTo(Geom::Point(100, 100));
 *     path->Close();
 *     path->ConvertEvenLines(0.001); // You can use the other variants too
 *     // insteresting stuff here

   * Approximate the passed cubic bezier with line segments.
   *
   * Basically the function checks if the passed cubic Bezier is "small enough" and if
   * it is, it does nothing, if it however isn't "small enough", it splits the cubic Bezier
   * curve into two cubic Bezier curves (split at mid point), recursively calls itself on the
   * left cubic, add the midpoint to the polyline approximation, call itself on the right
   * cubic and done. lev is the maximum recursion depth possible, once it's reached, the function
   * returns doing nothing immediately. See the code to understand more about maxL.
   *
   * The way the algorithm checks if the curve is "small enough" is maths so I'll try to
   * explain it here so you can see the equations printed and probably refer it when reading code.
   *
   * Let \f$\vec{p_{0}}\f$, \f$\vec{p_{1}}\f$, \f$\vec{p_{2}}\f$ and \f$\vec{p_{3}}\f$ be the four
   * points that define a cubic Bezier. The first is the start point, last is the end point,
   * the two in between are the control points. Given this let me relate these points to the
   * arguments that were passed in.
   *
   * \f[ \vec{iS} = \vec{p_{0}}\f]
   * \f[ \vec{iE} = \vec{p_{3}}\f]
   * \f[ \vec{iSd} = 3 (\vec{p_{1}} - \vec{p_{0}})\f]
   * \f[ \vec{iEd} = 3 (\vec{p_{3}} - \vec{p_{2}})\f]
   *
   * This is just how livarot represents a Cubic Bezier, nothing I can do about that. The code
   * starts by calculating a vector from start point to end point.
   *
   * \f[ \vec{se} = \vec{iE} - \vec{iS} ]\f
   *
   * If the length of \f$\vec{se}\f$ is smaller than 0.01, then the cubic bezier's endpoints are
   * kinda close, but if the control points are too far away, it can still be a long tall curve,
   * so let's see the control points and see how far away they are from the \f$\vec{se}\f$ vector.
   * To do that, we measure the lengths of \f$\vec{iSd}\f$ and \f$\vec{iEd}\f$. If both are below
   * threshold, we return immediately since it indicates the cubic bezier is "small enough".
   *
   * if the length is greater than 0.01, we still check the y projections of the control handles
   * on the line between start and end points, if these projections are limited by the threshold
   * and we didn't mess up the maxL restriction, we are good.
   *
   * If we ran out of recursion levels, we return anyways. In case this cubic bezier isn't small
   * enough, we split it in two parts. There are math equations in the code that do this and I
   * spent hours deriving it and they are totally correct. Basically take the usual maths to split
   * a cubic Bezier into two parts and just account for the factor of 3 in the control handles
   * that livarot adds and you'll end up with correct equations.
   *
   * TODO: Add derivation here maybe?
