 * A node in the sweep tree. For details about the sweep tree, what it is, what we do with it,

 *
 * Explanation of what is stored in evt and why:
 * Say you have two edges in the sweepline `left` and `right` and an intersection is detected between
 * the two. An intersection event (of type SweepEvent) is created and that event object stores
 * pointer to the `left` and `right` edges (of type SweepTree). The left edge's evt[RIGHT]/evt[1]
 * stores the pointer to the intersection event and the right edge's evt[LEFT]/evt[0] also stores
 * it. This is done for a very important reason. If any point in time, either the LEFT or the RIGHT
 * edge have to change their position in the sweepline for any reason at all (before the
 * intersection point comes), we need to immediately delete that event from our list, cuz the edges
 * are no longer together.

     * Find where the new edge needs to go in the sweepline tree.
     *
     * Please check out the documentation of the other version of Find that takes
     * a point as input, this function is exactly identical except one block of code.
     *
     * For that special block of code, see this picture.
     *
     * @image html livarot-images/find-point-same.svg
     *
     * The rest of the function is the same as the other Find function so you're already
     * familiar with how it works. The difference is how the y == 0 case is handled. When we are
     * within that block, it's established that the upper endpoint of the new edge is on our edge.
     * Now we see how the rest of the edge is orientated with respect to our edge so we can decide
     * where to put it. To do this, we get the edge vector of the new edge and make sure it's top
     * to bottom or if horizontal left to right. Then we rotate this new edge vector
     * counter-clockwise by 90 degrees and shift it so that it starts at the same point as
     * bNorm.ccw() does. The picture takes two cases simultaneously, one with edge red and the
     * other being edge magenta. Their normals are shown with dotted lines and the shifted versions
     * are lighter in color.
     *
     * Now if sweepSens is false, we take a cross product of new edge's normal with this edge's
     * normal or cross(nNorm, bNorm). To figure out the direction of a cross product in SVG
     * coordinates use this variation of right hand rule. Let index finger point to vector A. Let
     * middle finger point to vector B. If thumb points out of page, cross product is negative, if
     * it points inside the page, cross product is positive. Now you can see how when sweepSens is
     * false, the cross product checks out with the orientation of the edges. If the cross product
     * turns out to be zero, then we take dot product and let that decide. TODO: Which orientation
     * will do what though?
     *
     * What about the other condition of sweepSens? When would sweepSens be true and how would that
     * be useful. I think it has to do with sweeping in the opposite direction as a comment in the
     * function already says.
     *
     * @image html livarot-images/find-point-same-opp-sweepsense.svg
     *
     * In this image, you can see the edges go bottom to top and then, you'd need cross(bNorm,
     * nNorm) to figure out the correct orientation.

     * @param iPt The point whose location we need to find in the sweepline.

    /**
     * Find the place for a point (not an edge) in the sweepline tree.
     *
     * @image html livarot-images/find-point.svg
     *
     * To learn the algorithm, check the comments in the function body while referring back to
     * the picture shown above. A brief summary follows.
     *
     * We start by taking our edge vector and if it goes bottom to top, or is horizontal and goes
     * right to left, we flip its direction. In the picture bNorm shows this edge vector after any
     * flipping. We rotate bNorm by 90 degrees counter-clockwise to get the normal vector.
     * Then we take the start point of the edge vector (the original start point not the
     * one after flipping) and draw a vector from the start point to the point whose position we
     * are trying to find (iPt), we call this the diff vector. In the picture I have drawn these
     * for three points red, blue and green. Now we take the dot product of this diff with the
     * normal vectors. As you would now, a dot product has the formula:
     * \f[ \vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = |\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\cos\theta \f]
     * \f$ \theta \f$ here is the angle between the two. As you would know, \f$ \cos \f$ is
     * positive as long as the angle is between +90 and -90. At 90 degrees it becomes zero and
     * greater than 90 or smaller than -90 it becomes negative. Thus the sign of the dot product
     * can be used as an indicator of the angle between the normal vector and the diff vector.
     * If this angle is within 90 to -90, it means the point lies to the right of the original
     * edge. If it lies on 90 or -90, it means the point lies on the same line as the edge and
     * if it's greater than 90 or smaller than -90, the point lies on the left side of the
     * original edge.
     *
     * One thing to note, the blue point here is kinda wrong. You can't have another edge starting
     * above the already existing edge when sweeping done (that's just not possible). So sorry
     * about that. But the math checks out anyways. TODO: Maybe fix this to avoid confusion?
     *
     * One important point to see here is that the edge vector will be flipped however it's start
     * point remains the same as the original one, this is not a problem as you can see in the
     * image below. I chose the other point as the start point and everything works out the same.
     *
     * @image html livarot-images/find-point-2.svg
     *
     * I changed the starting point and redrew the diff vectors. Then I projected them such that
     * their origin is the same as that of the normal. Measuring the angles again, everything
     * remains the same.
     *
     * There is one more confusion part you'd find in this function. The part where left and right
     * child are checked and you'd see child as well as elem pointers being used.
     *
     * @image html livarot-images/sweep-tree.svg
     *
     * The picture above shows you a how the sweepline tree structure looks like. I've used numbers
     * instead of actual edges just for the purpose of illustration. The structure is an AVL tree
     * as well as double-linked list. The nodes are arranged in a tree structure that balances
     * itself but each node has two more points elem[LEFT] and elem[RIGHT] that can be used to
     * navigate the linked list. In reality, the linked list structure is what's needed, but having
     * an AVL tree makes searching really easy.
     *
     * See the comments in the if blocks in the function body. I've given examples from this
     * diagram to explain stuff.
