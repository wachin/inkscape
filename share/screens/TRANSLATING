# Explanation

The start screen can sometimes have text placed upon it. This text will need
to be translated into other languages and converted into an image, this guide
will explain how you can translate these texts correctly.

Files with the prefix `-text.svg` contain translatable text.
Localized versions are saved as `$name-text.$lang.svg`.
The files `$name-text.$lang.svg` will be rendered on top of the corresponding
PNG files with the name `$name.png` when the interface is loaded.

# Instructions

Each translation should be a separate SVG file. The goal of these instructions
is to create a translated version of the text. In this example we will be
translating the welcome-start.svg file for Inkscape 1.1 into Japanese.

## Step One: Get the file

The source files are NOT in the Inkscape repository, but are kept in the
media repository here:

https://gitlab.com/inkscape/vectors/content/-/tree/master/screens/welcome

 1. Navigate into the directory which has the same name as the version
    of Inkscape you are translating. In this example we will use `1.1`
 2. Install all the fonts in the fonts directory, if it exists. You don't
    have to use these fonts, but they will let you see the original design
    in the way it was intended.
 3. Download the SVG file. It contains the full design, not just the text.
    For this example we download `welcome-start.svg`

## Step Two: Edit the SVG

 1. Open the SVG file in the latest version of Inkscape. For example, use
    the Inkscape alpha or beta release if you can.
 2. Open the layers dialog in Inkscape. You should see two layers, one 
    labeled `Text` and one `Base`. If you don't find a `Text` layer,
    this startup graphic might not have any text to translate.
 3. Make sure the Text layer is visible by pressing the eye in the layers
    dialog.
 4. Edit the text, try to keep to the same design, colours and spacing if
    possible. But if you need to use a different font, reorder things or
    make it more attractive in your language, please do.
 5. Convert the text to paths using `Path > Object To Path`
 6. Delete the Layer that is marked as `Base` so you only have the text layer.
 7. Run `File > Clean Up Document` to remove unneeded elements.

## Step Three: Saving and Committing

 1. Save as a `Plain SVG` document in the screens folder. For our example the
    name will be `share/screens/welcome-start-text.ja.svg`
 2. Add the new file using git tools (see other instructions for how to commit
    and push merge requests or ask for help)
