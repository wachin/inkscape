=head1 NAME

Inkview - an SVG viewer and slideshow program.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<inkview [options] [filename ...]>

options:

    -h, --help
    -V, --version

    -f, --fullscreen
    -r, --recursive
    -t, --timer=NUMBER
    -s, --scale=NUMBER
    -p, --preload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Inkview> is an B<Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)> viewer that can also be
used for slideshows or presentations. One or more B<FILES> or B<FOLDERS> can
be specified on the command-line for opening. Inkview will display all SVG
files in the given order. Folders will be expanded to a list of contained SVG
files.

You can also launch Inkview without any command-line arguments, which will
bring up a file chooser that allows to select files and folders via a
graphical user interface.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-?>, B<--help>

Show help options

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print Inkview version and build date (this is usually matches the Inkscape version).

=item B<-f>, B<--fullscreen>

Launch Inkview in fullscreen mode.

=item B<-r>, B<--recursive>

Search folders specified on the command line recursively for SVG files.
This means all SVG files in all subfolders of the specified folder will be opened.

=item B<-t>, B<--timer=NUMBER>

Change to the next image every NUMBER seconds

=item B<-s>, B<--scale=NUMBER>

Show image scaled by a factor of NUMBER instead of using the file's native size.

=item B<-p>, B<--preload>

Preloads all SVG files. Inkview still needs to render images upon showing,
however this option ensures all SVG files are already parsed and loaded into
memory. This option can also be used to verify if all files can be opened
properly, without having to cycle through all files manually.
